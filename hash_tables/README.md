# #Hash Tables
You mean like Tic-Tac-Toe?

---
Hash tables are similar to linked lists, but it's more like a phone book
than a chain. A hash table takes a key, a string, and translates it into an
index number, which specifies its value's location in the table. However,
collisions can occur where two or more keys can translate into the same
index. This can be handled in several ways, one of which is by using linked
lists. As of when I wrote this, I don't understand it well enough to
explain how it works. I actually have no clue how the hash values (indexes)
are generated or how it knows which item is correct when searching for a
value that had a collision with another.
See `hashTableExample.jpg` for an example.
